# Comprehensive Analysis of AAV Infection Dynamics and Neuron Populations

## 1. Epitope Co-occurrence Analysis
This analysis reveals which epitopes tend to be expressed together in each population.
The heatmaps show co-expression frequencies, with the differential map highlighting
epitope combinations that are enriched in the Overexpressors population.

## 2. Hierarchical Clustering Analysis
This dendrogram shows how neurons cluster based on their epitope expression patterns,
revealing potential subpopulations within the main Expected Population and Overexpressors groups.

## 3. Infection Marker Correlation Analysis
This analysis examines the relationship between viral load (as measured by total signal intensity)
and the number of channels expressed, providing insights into infection dynamics in each population.

## 4. Channel Preference Analysis
This analysis identifies epitopes that are preferentially expressed in one population versus the other,
potentially revealing biological differences in infection susceptibility or expression mechanisms.

## 5. Dimensionality Reduction Analysis
The t-SNE visualization maps the high-dimensional epitope expression patterns into 2D space,
revealing the separation between neuron populations and potential substructures within them.

## 6. Epitope Network Analysis
These network diagrams visualize epitope co-expression patterns as a graph, with nodes representing
epitopes (sized by frequency) and edges representing co-expression strength, highlighting differences
in co-expression patterns between the two populations.

## 7. NGS Correlation Analysis
This analysis correlates epitope expression frequencies with viral and plasmid frequencies from NGS data,
investigating how the input viral pool composition influences expression patterns in each population.
