# Barcode Collision Analysis - Population Comparison

## Expected Population
Total cells: 947
Unique barcode patterns: 519
Percentage of cells with unique barcodes: 38.23%

## Overexpressors
Total cells: 236
Unique barcode patterns: 166
Percentage of cells with unique barcodes: 62.71%

The comparison plot shows the percentage of cells with different collision counts for both populations.
This analysis helps understand if one population has more unique barcodes than the other,
which could indicate different biological properties or technical artifacts.
